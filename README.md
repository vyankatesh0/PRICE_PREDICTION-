# PRICE_PREDICTION-


#Stock Trend Predictor
This project is a stock trend predictor that uses historical stock data to predict the future price trend of a given stock. It leverages machine learning techniques and the Keras library for building and training a neural network model.

Installation
Clone the repository:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vyankatehpophale0/PRICE_PREDICTION-.git
Install the required dependencies:

shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the application:

shell
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to access the application.

Enter the stock ticker symbol in the text input field.

Explore the different features and visualizations provided by the application:

Summary statistics of the stock's historical data.
Closing price vs. time chart.
Moving average analysis.
Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the application:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. yfinance
5. keras
6. streamlit

On the home page, you will see a form where you can enter the date for which you want to predict the stock price.

Select the date from the calendar picker and click on the "Predict" button.

The application will use the LSTM model to predict the stock price for the specified date and display it on the page.

You can repeat the process by entering different dates and obtaining their corresponding predicted stock prices.

**Notes**
The LSTM model provided in this web application is trained on historical stock price data and may not always produce accurate predictions. Stock price prediction is a complex task and depends on various factors beyond historical data.

It is recommended to use the web application for educational and experimental purposes only. Always consult with financial professionals or conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.

The LSTM model can be further improved by experimenting with different hyperparameters, adding more features, or using alternative models or algorithms.

The web application is designed to handle single stock prediction. If you want to predict multiple stocks, additional modifications and enhancements will be required.
